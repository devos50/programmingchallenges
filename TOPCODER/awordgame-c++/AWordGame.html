Consider the following game played between two players (let's call them Joe and Mary):
Joe starts the game by thinking of some English word. He doesn't tell Mary what word,
but instead tells Mary the first letter in his word. Now it's Mary's turn, who must think of
a word that starts with the letter Joe has revealed. She then tells Joe the first
two letters of her word. Now Joe must think of some word again (which may or may not
be the same as Joe's original word), starting with the two letters of Mary's word, and tell
Mary the first three letters in his word.
</p>

<p>
This procedure is repeated until the letters that are spoken by either Joe or Mary form a complete word.
The player who first forms a complete word loses the game.
This means that even if Joe thinks of the word &quot;fire&quot; and tells Mary the first three letters,
&quot;fir&quot;, he loses because &quot;fir&quot; is also a valid English word.
</p>

<p>
In reality, the player with the biggest word knowledge will most often win this game, but in this
problem we will assume that both players know exactly the same words (and that none
of them bluff or cheat). If both players play perfectly, it's possible to determine the outcome of the
game. We define &quot;perfect play&quot; to be when a player strives to win the game in as few turns as possible
(knowing that his opponent also plays perfectly), but also, if he/she can't win the game, to lose as slowly
as possible. See examples 0 and 1 for clarification.
</p>

<p>
The outcome of the game is the final word said by the player who loses. Note that if the
length of this word is odd, it means the second player will win since the first player
will always say sequences with an odd number of letters, and vice versa. If at any point it doesn't
matter which letter a player chooses, he/she will choose the one that is alphabetically first (see example 2).
</p>

<p>
Create a class AWordGame containing the method outcome that takes a vector &lt;string&gt;
<b>wordList</b> containing the words that both players know, and returns a string,
the final word said by the player that loses the game. Each element in <b>wordList</b>
will contain a space separated list of words.

Let's call the two players Joe and Mary, as before. At the beginning of the
game, Joe can choose between the letters 'p' and 't', since all words in
the wordlist start with either of these letters. Assume first that he
chooses 'p'. Mary can then choose 'a', which will narrow down the possible
words left to only &quot;pascal&quot;. Since that's a word with even length,
Mary will lose the game if she chooses 'a'. However, if she chooses 'r',
so the two first letters are &quot;pr&quot;, she will win the game since Joe
will be forced to say &quot;program&quot;. Hence Joe will lose the game after
7 turns if he starts the game with 'p'.
</p>

<p>
If Joe starts with 't', Mary will choose 'r' since choosing 'a' will lead
to the work &quot;task&quot; which causes Joe to win. Now Joe will choose 'e' as the third
letter since choosing 'a' will cause Joe lose the game with the word &quot;trace&quot;
in two more turns. Mary is forced to select 'a' (the four first letters are now
&quot;trea&quot;), and Joe must select 'c' to avoid immediate loss. The next three
letters, 'h' (by Mary), 'e' (by Joe), 'r' (by Mary) are all forced. Joe
can now choose between 'y' and 'o', but both these choices will also
lead to a loss. Hence Joe will always lose the game, no matter what he does.
The slowest loss is along the most recent path discussed, eventually leading
to the word &quot;treacherous&quot;.

Here we have the same word list as above, with the exception that
the word &quot;program&quot; has been removed. If Joe starts the game with 't',
he will of course lose again since the absence of &quot;program&quot; won't
affect the outcome then. If he chooses 'p' however, he will win the game,
because the two words starting with 'p' both have even length. Mary,
who after Joe's first turn can select which of the two words will be left,
will of course select 'r' since the word &quot;programmer&quot; is longer than &quot;pascal&quot;
(and thus a slower loss).

If Joe starts with 'b', he will lose the game because Mary will then select 'o'
and win the game with the word &quot;board&quot;. If Joe starts with some other letter,
he will win the game since all other words have even length. The fastest
win is any of the words &quot;code&quot;, &quot;cola&quot;, &quot;cute&quot; or &quot;hack&quot; (but not &quot;academic&quot;).
</p>

<p>
Since selecting both 'c' and 'h' will lead to a fastest win, Joe will
select 'c' because it's the first of these letters alphabetically. Mary
can select between 'o' and 'u', but since both words will lead to a loss
in two more turns, she chooses 'o' which comes before 'u' in the alphabet.
Similarly, Joe will next time choose 'd' (comes before 'l') and the
final word will then be &quot;code&quot;.
